                <p>In our admissions process, we give careful, individual attention to each applicant. We seek to 
                identify students who will be the best educators of one another and their professors individuals
                who will inspire those around them during their College years and beyond. As we read and discuss
                your application, here are some things that will be on our minds.</p>

                    Our admissions process enables us to give deliberate and meticulous consideration of each 
                    applicant as a whole person. It is labor intensive, but permits extraordinary flexibility 
                    and the possibility of changing decisions virtually until the day the Admissions Committee 
                    mails them. This is especially important since we are always receiving new information about 
                    applicants. Of course, no process is perfect. Inevitably, some students who are not admitted 
                    will see great success, and even with a 97 to 98 percent graduation rate, some admitted 
                    students might have been better served at another institution. We do everything possible
                     to make the best admissions decision for each student.
